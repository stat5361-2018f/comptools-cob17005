I encountered a couple of challenges in my quest to get the PDF file on a Windows system. First, I had to install a buch of packages from CRAN. Next, I had to install devtools, lobstr from GitHub. My next problem was with regard to the function detectCores(). detectCores() is not supported by Windows, so I had to do some small changes to the code in order to make it work. There are some hints offered by the author, on how to change the code. After I've made the suggested changes, I was able to overcome the problem. After that I had to reinstall MiKTeX. The older version of MiKTeX had some bugs that were affecting my code. Finally, I had to install the font inconsolata to obtain the PDF file.
